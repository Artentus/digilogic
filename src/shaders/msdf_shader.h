    Overview:

        Shader program 'msdf':
            Get shader desc: msdf_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_coord = 0
                    ATTR_vs_color = 1
            Fragment shader: fs
                Image 'iTexChannel0':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Sample Type: SG_IMAGESAMPLETYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_iTexChannel0 = 0
                Sampler 'iSmpChannel0':
                    Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FILTERING
                    Bind slot: SLOT_iSmpChannel0 = 0
                Image Sampler Pair 'iTexChannel0_iSmpChannel0':
                    Image: iTexChannel0
                    Sampler: iSmpChannel0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader msdf = sg_make_shader(msdf_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

                },
            },
            ...});


    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

        SLOT_iTexChannel0 = 0;

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]

        SLOT_iSmpChannel0 = 0;
