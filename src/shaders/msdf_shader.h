                Uniform block 'msdfUniform':
                    C struct: msdfUniform_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_msdfUniform = 0
                Image 'atlas':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Sample Type: SG_IMAGESAMPLETYPE_FLOAT

    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader msdf = sg_make_shader(msdf_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

        SLOT_atlas = 0;

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]

        SLOT_samp = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'msdfUniform':

        msdfUniform_t msdfUniform = {
            .scale = ...;
            .fgColor = ...;
            .bgColor = ...;
